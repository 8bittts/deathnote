To create the favicon.ico file:

1. Take the SVG from icon.svg
2. Use an online ICO converter:
   - Visit https://convertio.co/svg-ico/ or https://favicon.io/
   - Upload the icon.svg file
   - Download and save as favicon.ico in the public directory
   - Replace both this text file and any existing favicon.ico

An ICO file typically contains multiple sizes, commonly 16x16, 32x32, and 48x48 pixels.

The Death Note logo should include:
- A skull icon with a light border
- A small green question mark in the top left corner
- A small red X in the top right corner
