# DeathNote Application Refactoring Plan

## Identified Issues

1. **Duplicate Editor Implementation**
   - Two editor implementations exist: `EditorJsWrapper` and `TiptapEditor`
   - The app is currently using `TiptapEditor` while `EditorJsWrapper` is unused
   - EditorJS dependencies are still in package.json despite not being used

2. **Unused API Routes**
   - `/api/deepseek` and `/api/firecrawl` routes are defined but not used anywhere in the application
   - These appear to be placeholder/mock implementations

3. **Type Definitions**
   - Unused type definitions in `src/types/editorjs.d.ts`

4. **Potential Component Duplication**
   - Need to review component usage and identify any duplicated functionality

5. **Missing Documentation**
   - Insufficient inline documentation/comments
   - API documentation is missing
   - Component props documentation is incomplete

6. **Inconsistent File Organization**
   - Some components may not be in the correct directories based on their usage
   - Need to ensure consistency with the project structure defined in README

## Refactoring Plan

### 1. Code Cleanup

- Remove unused `EditorJsWrapper` component
- Remove unused EditorJS dependencies from package.json
- Remove or document unused API routes
- Clean up unused type definitions
- Remove any unused imports across the codebase

### 2. Component Refactoring

- Review all components for duplicated functionality
- Ensure consistent prop patterns across components
- Check for unused components or component props

### 3. API Cleanup and Documentation

- Either implement or remove the placeholder API routes
- Document all API endpoints with proper TypeScript interfaces
- Add JSDoc comments to all API function parameters

### 4. Documentation Enhancement

- Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to all components
- Document props for all components
- Create a CONTRIBUTING.md file with development guidelines
- Update README.md with more detailed setup instructions
- Add diagrams for data flow
- Include API documentation

### 5. Project Structure Optimization

- Ensure components are organized properly
- Verify route structure follows best practices
- Restructure any files that are in incorrect locations

### 6. GitHub Repository Setup

- Initialize git repository
- Create initial commit with clean codebase
- Push to GitHub
- Set up GitHub actions for CI/CD
